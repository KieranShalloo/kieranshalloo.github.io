                        <p>The goal of the YouView High Contrast Mode was to enable users with a
                            wide range of visual issues to be able to use the YouView product at the same level as people
                            with no visual problems. As the BBC was a founding member of the YouView
                            product, it is essential that the company followed the BBC Trust guidelines for accessibility.
                            With this in mind, the approach to acceptance criteria for the YouView High Contrast mode was
                            much higher than it would be at other
                            companies. My experience working on the accessibility mode of the previous YouView UI made me a
                            prime candidate to lead the project and I took it on with the goal of making a great user
                            experience.

                    <div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2">
                        <p>We took the initial research from previous accessibility work as a starting point for this new
                            project. In the previous YouView design, the team worked very closely with partially sighted
                            users for a constant stream of feedback and
                            we continued this process we moved towards the next phase of the user interface. As a team, we
                            were also in constant communication with two of the UK’s biggest disability charities the RNIB
                            and SCOPE to give us an insight into
                            the challenges that people with disabilities face in day to day life.
                            <br><br> A big part of our research came in the way of using a toolkit from the University of
                            Cambridge which allowed the product design team to simulate mild vision loss. This toolkit
                            consisted of glasses which replicated acuity
                            and contrast loss. These glasses could then be stacked up on top of each other to analyse how
                            different level of eyesight issues will affect the ability to see and interact with the product
                            <br><br> We also spent time conducting competitive research in both the TV industry and wider,
                            trying to get a sense of where the competition put their focus on helping disabled customers. By
                            looking at rivals we could see where
                            the gap in the market stood and how we could use our expertise to create a bespoke experience
                            that solved the brief and created the best solutions

                        <p>One of the main challenges in creating a UI based around accessibility is the need to remove any
                            gradient that could obscure text. This was reported by both charities as the main reason why
                            partially sighted users will struggle with
                            the experience. With this in mind we had to explore how to approach the design in regard to
                            this, comparing the removal of the gradient with the idea of shifting it further on the screen
                            Comparing different concepts for the tile
                            asset Another challenge was the highlight state for the sections of the UI. After User Research
                            and testing it led to having a few ideas, most of which consisted of a solid highlight state.
                            These versions were then presented to
                            both charities and a number of the user-base with eyesight issues. Feedback taught us that solid
                            bright highlight states were actually worse for the user as it caused a bleeding halo-like
                            effect which did not increase visibility
                            at all and rendered nearby text completely unreadable.

                            We wanted to present two concepts that worked to solve the original brief. Using the evidence
                            and information we gathered from our user-research as well as our deep look at the competition
                            we presented two different concepts to stakeholders. Both had
                            gone through vigorous prototyping and testing in the team and we were looking for final feedback
                            before we took the project into our agile backlog.
                            <br> <br> The feedback we received from our concepts shaped the final stages of design and
                            altered some of our directions as we moved into development. We were given the green light to
                            progress with the black version of the UI
