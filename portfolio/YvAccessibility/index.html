                <p>Create an accessible version of the YouView UI, taking into account various sight-related
                    disabilities to make the platform easy to use by all. Partly powered by the BBC, there are
                    strict
                    guidlines that have to be adhert too to ensure
                    support from the BBC Trust</p>

                <h2>Desiging for multiple screens</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2">
                <p>The goal of the YouView High Contrast Mode was to enable users with a
                    wide range of visual issues to be able to use the YouView product at the same level as people
                    with no visual problems. As the BBC was a founding member of the YouView
                    product, it is essential that the company followed the BBC Trust guidelines for accessibility.
                    With this in mind, the approach to acceptance criteria for the YouView High Contrast mode was
                    much higher than it would be at other
                    companies. My experience working on the accessibility mode of the previous YouView UI made me a
                    prime candidate to lead the project and I took it on with the goal of making a great user
                    experience.

                <h3>User Research</h3>

                <p>We took the initial research from previous accessibility work as a starting point for this new
                    project. In the previous YouView design, the team worked very closely with partially sighted
                    users for a constant stream of feedback and
                    we continued this process we moved towards the next phase of the user interface. As a team, we
                    were also in constant communication with two of the UK’s biggest disability charities the RNIB
                    and SCOPE to give us an insight into
                    the challenges that people with disabilities face in day to day life.
                    <br><br> A big part of our research came in the way of using a toolkit from the University of
                    Cambridge which allowed the product design team to simulate mild vision loss. This toolkit
                    consisted of glasses which replicated acuity
                    and contrast loss. These glasses could then be stacked up on top of each other to analyse how
                    different level of eyesight issues will affect the ability to see and interact with the product
                    <br><br> We also spent time conducting competitive research in both the TV industry and wider,
                    trying to get a sense of where the competition put their focus on helping disabled customers. By
                    looking at rivals we could see where
                    the gap in the market stood and how we could use our expertise to create a bespoke experience
                    that solved the brief and created the best solutions

                <h3>Digital Process</h3>

                <p>One of the main challenges in creating a UI based around accessibility is the need to remove any
                    gradient that could obscure text. This was reported by both charities as the main reason why
                    partially sighted users will struggle with
                    the experience. With this in mind we had to explore how to approach the design in regard to
                    this, comparing the removal of the gradient with the idea of shifting it further on the screen
                    Comparing different concepts for the tile
                    asset Another challenge was the highlight state for the sections of the UI. After User Research
                    and testing it led to having a few ideas, most of which consisted of a solid highlight state.
                    These versions were then presented to
                    both charities and a number of the user-base with eyesight issues. Feedback taught us that solid
                    bright highlight states were actually worse for the user as it caused a bleeding halo-like
                    effect which did not increase visibility
                    at all and rendered nearby text completely unreadable.

                <h3>Concepts</h3>


                <p>
                    We wanted to present two concepts that worked to solve the original brief. Using the evidence
                    and information we gathered from our user-research as well as our deep look at the competition
                    we presented two different concepts to stakeholders. Both had
                    gone through vigorous prototyping and testing in the team and we were looking for final feedback
                    before we took the project into our agile backlog.
                    <br> <br> The feedback we received from our concepts shaped the final stages of design and
                    altered some of our directions as we moved into development. We were given the green light to
                    progress with the black version of the UI
                    and started to create assets and specifications for the developers

                    first place for customers.
                    <br><br>I ensured that these touches remained even when the user wanted the High Contrast option
                    turned on.
