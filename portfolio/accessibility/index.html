          <p style="color: whitesmoke;">The goal of the YouView High Contrast Mode was to enable users with a wide range
            of
            visual issues to be able to use the YouView product at the same level as people with no visual problems. As
            the BBC was a founding
            member of the
            YouView product, it is essential that the company followed the BBC Trust guidelines for accessibility. With
            this in mind, the approach to acceptance criteria for the YouView High Contrast mode was much higher than it
            would be at other
            companies. My experience working on the accessibility mode of the previous YouView UI made me a prime
            candidate to lead the project and I took it on with the goal of making a great user experience.

          <h4>User Research</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2">
          <p>We took the initial research from previous accessibility work as a starting point for this new project. In
            the previous YouView design, the team worked very closely with partially sighted users for a constant stream
            of feedback and we
            continued this process we moved towards the next phase of the user interface.
            As a team, we were also in constant communication with two of the UK’s biggest disability charities the
            RNIB and SCOPE to give us an insight into the challenges that people with disabilities face in day to day
            life.
            <br><br>
            A big part of our research came in the way of using a toolkit from the University of Cambridge which allowed
            the product design team to simulate mild vision loss. This toolkit consisted of glasses which replicated
            acuity and contrast
            loss.
            These glasses could then be stacked up on top of each other to analyse how different level of eyesight
            issues will affect the ability to see and interact with the product
            <br><br>
            We also spent time conducting competitive research in both the TV industry and wider, trying to get a sense
            of where the competition put their focus on helping disabled customers. By looking at rivals we could see
            where the gap in the
            market stood and how we could use our expertise to create a bespoke experience that solved the brief and
            created the best solutions

          <h4>Digital Process</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2">
          <p>One of the main challenges in creating a UI based around accessibility is the need to remove any gradient
            that could obscure text. This was reported by both charities as the main reason why partially sighted users
            will struggle with
            the
            experience. With this in mind we had to explore how to approach the design in regard to this, comparing the
            removal of the gradient with the idea of shifting it further on the screen
            Comparing different concepts for the tile asset
            Another challenge was the highlight state for the sections of the UI. After User Research and testing it led
            to having a few ideas, most of which consisted of a solid highlight state. These versions were then
            presented to both charities
            and a number of the user-base with eyesight issues. Feedback taught us that solid bright highlight states
            were actually worse for the user as it caused a bleeding halo-like effect which did not increase visibility
            at all and rendered
            nearby text completely unreadable.

          <p style="color: whitesmoke;">
            We wanted to present two concepts that worked to solve the original brief. Using the evidence and
            information we gathered from our user-research as well as our deep look at the competition we presented two
            different concepts to
            stakeholders. Both had gone through vigorous prototyping and testing in the team and we were looking for
            final feedback before we took the project into our agile backlog.
            <br> <br>
            The feedback we received from our concepts shaped the final stages of design and altered some of our
            directions as we moved into development. We were given the green light to progress with the black version of
            the UI and started to
            create assets and specifications for the developers
