                <p style="color: var( --dark)">With these smaller pieces of content being developed, The team
                    was
                    missing a strong future vision. Working with a
                    collection of Trainline employees i helped to craft a long term strategy piece which would
                    create interest in the
                    platform with the goal of rewarding users who remain customers year in, year out.<br> <br>
                    We decided to focus on the problem that Trainline currently treated their userbase exactly
                    the
                    same on day 1 on the
                    platform as they did on day 1000. We wanted to show how Trainline could reward the users who
                    came back
                    <br> <br>
                    With our problem statement agreed, I went away and worked on some high level conceptual
                    pieces
                    which could in turn form
                    an overall long-term focus ready to be split into manageable product stories and projects.
                    <br> <br>Once these were presented back we had positive feedback on three ideas we were
                    recommended to take forward,
                    These were….

            <div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2">
                <h3 style="color: var( --dark)">Loyalty Scheme</h3>

                <p style="color: var( --dark)">Here we crafted a way to reward users. We had two different
                    approaches which we designed and took into user testing.
                    <br> <br>
                    The first approach was to give the user points as a reward system. This could then unlock
                    rewards to further the users
                    experience given them access to unique awards and limited availability discounts.<br> <br>
                    As this was all conceptual pieces of work we could really push the interaction design and
                    utilise patterns and logic
                    that didn’t currently exist on the platforms. Using figma to create prototypes allowed us to
                    create fast turnaround for
                    usability testing to really get user feedback on our overall concept pieces

                <h3 style="color: var( --dark)">Railcard recommendation</h3>

                <p style="color: var( --dark)">Users had commented via social media platforms that when
                    pourchasing
                    tickets, Trainline wasn’t giving clear
                    communication on ways the user could save money when they could purchase a railcard. <br>
                    <br>This one off payment could
                    save money for a user making journeys regularly and was an easy way to encourage users to
                    stay
                    on the platform post
                    journey. <br> <br>My hypothesis was by ensuring we the users side, even with a loss on the
                    journey this could help
                    transfer users from a one time purchase to a reoccurring customer.

            <div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2">
                <h3 style="color: var( --dark)">Savings accumulation</h3>

                <p style="color: var( --dark)">The first piece of work was created to enable users to see the
                    benefits of Trainline as they became more frequent users.
                    I conceived up ways to show the user how much money they had saved by using Trainline,
                    highlighting unique features that
                    the user couldn't get anywhere else such as SplitSave (a way Trainline splits tickets for a
                    cheaper fare) as well as CO2
                    savings and time savings compared to travelling by car.<br> <br>
                    This in turn would co-exist with the company's existing sustainability practises and would
                    long
                    term give the user a
                    full view of their savings beyond exclusively cost.<br> <br>

                    There were various aspects of the design that we iterated the phone. The initial design
                    started
                    with an interactive
                    graph, which users would instinctively be able to see how their savings have grown over the
                    last
                    30 days 90 days or six
                    months. <br> <br>This in tern was connected to an overall number at the top of the screen,
                    which
                    would been updated with
                    a growing accumulated savings since the user had been a Trainline member

                    This graph also became a great way to also upsell of the savings accumulated jour instance
                    an
                    easy way for the user to
                    jump into the sustainability story section of the app to see how much CO2 they had saved
                    before
                    we could integrate the
                    long-term vision without removing the MVP speed of build and iteration .<br> <br>

                    When user are testing we also looked at giving the user the ability to see exactly where
                    they
                    had saved their money.
                    This could have been done between individual journeys individual journey times or
                    destinations
                    during user testing. This
                    didn’t have as much positive response as I initially thought uses saying that although it’s
                    quite beneficial, it didn’t
                    really add to the oval experience so this was and then the user would do this much epoured
                    from
                    the MVP and Was put in
                    the backlog to work on and design further
