                    Google has introduced a Google train module, which allows users to search for their journeys on
                    google rather than using
                    the trainline service.
                    Whilst good for the user the integration with the trainline allows users to go directly to the
                    train search result
                    without seeing any of the user benefits of using the Trainline platform.

                <h3>Approaching the problem</h3>

                <p>With a view to get this feature live as fast as possible we had a 5 day turn around to go from a
                    concept to a design
                    that was ready for development. I took the initiative to bring some elements of existing designs
                    and concepts already in
                    the design system to bring this to life. With one eye on the developer resource needed for this
                    project it was all about
                    quick wins and a scalable concept we could iterate on top of!</p>

                <h3>Targeting the users</h3>

                <p>With this project needing an urgent turnaround, the first aspect was to be able to reuse some
                    design system principles
                    but to adjust them for the users coming from the Google Trains platform. Especially targeting
                    the EU and USA customer
                    markets.
                    This, for me, meant that we should value the journey the user has made to come to the trainline
                    above everything else.
                    <br><br>
                    These users had come to the Trainline product from an external third party Google search module
                    , and as such the goal
                    was to try and sell the product features but with the key incentive was to not disrupt the
                    user's main goal. A positive
                    first exposure were essential especially in markets where the Trainline brand didn't have that
                    big brand recognition.

                <h3>First iteration</h3>
                <p>Adding the logic of what the user had been doing before they landed on this page, we knew that
                    the user had to have
                    clicked on a journey on the Google module to get to this screen. So I first brought this
                    selected train journey to the
                    very top of the page, ensuring it was clear and obvious that their journey was still right there
                    for them to purchase.
                    <br><br>
                    Underneath the selected journey I have added the biggest change for users from the google
                    platform. By adding a
                    reassurance message in an easy-to-access position which promotes the product and ensures the
                    user of the benefits of
                    using the Trainline platform.
                    <br><br>

                    This clickable element will open a new modal which will be able to sell personalised benefits of
                    the platform based on
                    common highly rated features with positive feedback.

                <h3>Design Details</h3>
                <p>I went through many different iterations of the design here as shown above before coming together
                    with the design team
                    to get the final design signed off. These designs were taken through usability testing to ensure
                    they hit our product
                    targets using an eternal resource alongside the Trainline internal research team.
                    <br><br>

                    As this design was aimed at multiple markets, I also worked closely with a UX copywriting team
                    to get each localeâ€™s
                    final copy as well as a localisation team for any translations needed before the design and copy
                    was signed off by legal
                    and marketing and then finally released to the public.

            <p>This module had an instant effect on the conversion of users. We saw a drop in users clicking through
                from Google and
                then leaving the platform. <br><br>We also unexpectedly saw an increase of users who came from
                google returning directly to the Trainline platform.<br><br>As this was the first short term
                iteration for this product, as soon as the public saw this version I was working on the
                second iteration with a much stronger emphasis on the Trainline brand, starting to incorporate more
                rich media into the
                product through animations and motion design.<br><br> The teams work across the whole project was
                one of the winners in Trainline's Tech and Product 2024 awards.</p>
