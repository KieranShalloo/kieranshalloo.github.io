                            that
                            was on the cutting edge of user experience and incorperating the latest back and front end
                            technologies. With this in mind, the YouView team decided to not

                    <p>The first step in this whole operation was to gather people from across the company and sell them
                        the vision of the next stage in the company. I worked alongside the Creative Director and a
                        select few designers, engineers and testers
                        and spent a few days away from the office to come up with some features which we would strongly
                        like to be included.


                        <br><br> At this point in the project, the idea was to create some really out of the box
                        thinking, trying to incorporate future facing technologies and to really stay ahead of rivals
                        products. We went into this stage knowing that
                        most of these ideas may not be able to be incorporated in the first release of the software, but
                        as the project was going to be an agile one with lots of iterations we could always wait for the
                        right time to launch more extravagant
                        features so they would go on the project backlog until ready.</p>

                        Looking at the whole user experience gave us the opportunity to really look at our designs again
                        from scratch. Since the original YouView interface had been created, the televisions in peoples
                        homes had become larger. More features and more screen real
                        estate, going from 720p being the norm all the way up to 8k and beyond. <br><br> The first port
                        of call for this was the grid that our whole design system would be built upon. As a design
                        team, we all took
                        our individual takes upon trying to create a grid which would work on TV whilst keeping in mind
                        the limitations and safe-zones. Although the industry had changed, with our goals of allowing
                        all customers to experience the next-generation
                        proposition we had to ensure older tv sets would still work.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--light)">Setup</h2>

                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <p style="color:var(--light)">

                        The setup journey was one that changed the most from our initial concepts. The idea that we
                        tried was one which was fully completed with an accompanying smartphone. the idea took the setup
                        journey away from the main screen and allowed a user to set their
                        location, preferences and internet connection via the app before they even received their
                        set-top box in the post. I was a strong advocate for this idea but it was deemed too expensive
                        by the company. <br><br> The setup journey that we launched with took a simple approach with the
                        minimum number of screens for a user to accurately choose their settings and to get them
                        watching TV as fast as possible. As this was the approach that was
                        the launch proposition it gave room to enable hints and tips which were pushed to a user on the
                        launch of a feature in the future. <br><br> Luckily I had created the templated for the settings
                        area at this point and it was easy
                        for the development team to use the same code to bring a uniform look to the setup area.

                    <p> The guide is the main way that people use the TV. In the house, the guide is still the king of
                        the service and as such, it was a difficult sell to really try and change the Guide for the
                        product too much. When we interviewed users
                        of the service as well as users of other TV experiences the majority of users wanted to have an
                        area which was familiar, and they could use without having to read a manual.
                        <br><br> We looked at a few concepts and complete redesigns for the guide. One idea that we felt
                        strongly about was the idea to bring imagery into the guide to give an instant view of TV shows
                        currently on.
                        <br><br> In the guide, one feature that has always been a unique selling point of the YouView
                        product was the ability to go back 7 days and play content instantly from the tv guide. The date
                        tracker on the guide was something it
                        was agreed would have to stay and would also have to remain a predominant feature, alongside the
                        filters to allow a user to quickly change the type of channel in the guide for the customer.

                        The old version of YouView had the main menu area which only consisted of the name of the
                        section which would be selected.
                        <br><br> With the new designs, we wanted to try and incorporate more visual content to allow the
                        user quick access to the tv shows they enjoy. In turn, this could be tweaked to allow the user
                        to have their favourite show in close
                        proximity to them to allow easy access. Shareholders would also be able to control the shows
                        they would want to promote to individual users. Sports fans could be shown new sports events
                        they would not necessarily know about. This
                        would allow an unprecedented level of personalisation in the UK tv marketplace
                        <br><br> A big discussion that was had around the main menu was the number of links we would
                        have on it. without wanting to overwhelm the user but also giving them the ability to navigate
                        across the system easily. The navigation
                        patterns consisting of the search icon and the settings area was also a hotly contested issue.
                        <br><br> The search selection state was intentionally e to look different from the rest of the
                        areas as it was the only area which on selection would not take the user to a full-screen
                        experience, so it should have a different
                        visual representation for the end user.

                        For the settings area of the UI, it had an interesting challenge. It was built as a separate app
                        inside the YouView interface. It was also the only section of the UI which was outsourced to a
                        different company, the development team from Massive Interactive
                        worked closely alongside the internal team, helping to create the vision I had for the settings
                        area. I led the work from the product design team on the settings area and created a template in
                        the first instance which would allow
                        the design to grow as new features and settings were implemented. Looking back, this was a good
                        choice as we quickly expanded the UI to contain many new options and customers quoted that the
                        settings being familiar e it easy for
                        them to customise the UI how they wanted.<br><br> We originally utilized a bigger tile size
                        which allowed the 3D imagery to be seen clearly but as the whole UI was adjusted for the smaller
                        tile sizes the
                        settings area followed suit. As settings areas are usually not the most visually attractive
                        areas of an interface I wanted to try and bring in some micro-interactions that would give the
                        settings area a touch of excitement and
                        meaningful delight to a user.

                        find the exact show that they wanted to find. In the first instances, the platform would link
                        the shows together regardless of where the content was coming
                        from. the idea here was as long as a user didn't have to pay extra then they wouldn't care about
                        where the show was coming from. From a business perspective, this wasn't allowed as the
                        shareholders wished to keep their branding
                        at the forefront of a user. We also had to change the idea that you would be able to play the
                        next episode of a brand from this screen as technical limitations didn't allow this. <br><br>
                        One feature that
                        we wanted to have prominence was the ability to start a new search from anywhere in the search
                        journey. This call to action had to be prominent enough for users without taking over the focus
                        for the customer. <br><br> After a few
                        rounds of user testing, we settled on this design. </p>

                        Discover was one of the most popular areas of the legacy YouView UI and its omission from the
                        first release of the next generation project was noted and criticised by the user-base. The
                        senior management team were made aware of the negative feedback and
                        brought together a team to try and solve the issue. Bringing discover back made it easier for
                        customers to find OnDemand tv shows and films that they would want to watch in a much easier
                        way. It is one of the most popular features
                        on the older boxes made it a lot more noticeable. The grand vision for this area would bring
                        together all the best parts from back end services that a customer would want such as 'Cast &
                        Crew' and IMDb ratings. It would also allow
                        cross promotion to other TV or Films that a customer would like such as a ‘More Like This’ area.
                        <br><br> Research into our high OnDemand persona lead us to some interesting results which in
                        turn allowed us to create some more unique designs. we crafted a number of designs based on the
                        older Radio-Times style of browsing for
                        content as

                    I worked on creating the future facing versions of the Discover area. The original version was
                    pushed out due to the negative feedback from users and in haste, just used the basic carousel view
                    that was used across other areas of the UI. I worked with
                    another senior product designer to try and craft a more visually appealing area. My main goal was to
                    have a large hero image which would represent the TV Show or Film selected allowing a visual
                    representation of the show for a user
                    who may not know about the content. We also tried to create a sub navigation to allow users to jump
                    directly
