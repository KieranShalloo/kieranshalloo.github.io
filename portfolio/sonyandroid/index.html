                        The YouView platform was rewritten in HTML5 to allow it to be loaded onto the SONY TV and this
                        allowed us the ability to upscale the interface to a native 1080p resolution, given the benefit
                        of pixel-perfect icons and typography for the user. The change
                        of technology also gave us the chance to use a component-based design system for the first time.

    <div class="containerfluid ">
        <div class=" container ">
            <div class="row ">
                <div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2 ">
                    <h3>On screen Keyboard</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2 ">
                    <p>
                        As the platform was to be navigated using the SONY remote control, it affected the search
                        section of the UI, leading us to create a bespoke On-screen keyboard exclusively for the YouView
                        Sony project. We had to craft this feature from scratch as the existing
                        user experience was based on text entry from the YouView remote, a feature which couldn’t be
                        replicated with the sony control. As part of our design process, we shared the user testing
                        results with the SONY team in Japan, helping
                        to ensure that the feature would not interfere with the onboard google universal search

                    <p style="color: whitesmoke;">With a service such as Android tv, the user has the ability to update
                        and replace apps with their own choices. This could lead to a case where the YouView features
                        are hidden from the user who in turn may struggle to find them again.
                        Part of the requirements allowed us to have a selection of key access points for the user,
                        including; the GUIDE & SEARCH key’s on the remote, a tile on the android home screen as well as

                        The Android home screen is the central point for the whole of the android TV interface. It is

                        allowed here, by creating a strong interactive element, as well
                        as creating flows which gave the maximum reach for the user to find the youview interface

                    <p> We presented our work to both senior members of our team as well as external stakeholders on a
                        regular basis. Using a agile review process it gave the teams abroad a way to be involved in the
                        design process and it gave the design team
                        a set goal to accomplish. Taking feedback was a tricky process as the separate companies all had
                        their own review process which led to a lot of time waiting for admin to pass through back into
                        useful design feedback. A company
                        as large as Sony has a very different process which consisted of various people and teams
                        syncing up before answers could be given.

                        to the impact of delivery times with the project. We looked to create bespoke versions of
                        existing patterns that our customers had become accustomed too. We create
                        a set of design components which corresponded with the development team and the google
