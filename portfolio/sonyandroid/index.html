                <h3>Bringing the YouView interface to the platform</h3>
                <p>
                    For this project, the YouView platform was completely rewritten in HTML5. With a technology
                    change, we could upscale the interface to a native 1080p resolution. A perfect opportunity for a
                    visual refresh of icons and typography for the user. The technology change also gave us the
                    chance to use an updated design system for the first time.

                <h3>On-Screen Keyboard</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2 ">
                <p>
                    As the navigation for the platform uses the Sony remote control, it affected the search section
                    of the UI. This led us to create a bespoke On-screen keyboard. This was an exclusive feature for
                    the YouView Sony project.
                    <br><br>
                    We had to craft this feature from scratch. The existing search user experience relies on text
                    entry from the YouView remote. Without control of certain buttons, this couldn’t be replicated
                    with the Sony input. As part of our design process, we shared the user testing results with the
                    Sony team in Japan. This ensured that the feature would not interfere with the default Google
                    search

                    We needed to have an easy clear experience from the users first interaction with the new TV
                    service. We integrated as part of the Google setup journey. This allowed us to promote the
                    benefits of the YouView features at the very first journey

                    We were able to bring the YouView benefits to the user with the project. By showcasing the
                    relationship we already had with major UK partners, we could promote unique programs now
                    available. This new content was now available at the touch of a button for people browsing for
                    new content.

                <p>With a service such as Android TV, the user has the ability to update

                    We didn't want the YouView features hidden from user's who in turn may struggle to find them
                    again.<br>
                    Our need gave us key access points for the user. These included both GUIDE & SEARCH remote
                    control buttons as well as a Tile on the android home screen. We also benefited from the control
                    of sections on SONY's customisable carousel

                    The Android home screen is the central point for the whole of the SONY TV interface. It is the
                    first and main point of interaction for the user. We created bespoke discovery flows, each
                    ending in promotion of YouView content. This allowed us to maximise the rewards of the space
                    permitted by Google.

                    By taking ownership of buttons on the remote control it also gave the ability for even more

                    Sony had an intergrated section of their UI which was also used to promote content. This gave an
                    additional section that could contain regulated content by YouView for the consumer. By again
                    working closely with the Sony team, we created journeys that could span across the three
                    different sections of the platform (android, Sony, YouView) </p>

            <p> We presented our work to both senior members of our team
                as well as external
                stakeholders on a
                regular basis. Using a agile review process it gave the teams abroad a way to be
                involved in the
                design process and it gave the design team
                a set goal to accomplish. Taking feedback was a tricky process as the separate
                companies all had
                their own review process which led to a lot of time waiting for admin to pass
                through back into
                useful design feedback. A company
                as large as Sony has a very different process which consisted of various people and
                teams
                syncing up before answers could be given.

        <p> As YouView was becoming the dominant brand in the Sony TV’s we also
            created some point of sale content to promote the upcoming release alongside Sony. This was the
            biggest partnership that YouView had been involved with so a lot of time and energy was spent to
            ensure that there were other eyes on the outcome of the project.

        <p> This promotion work didn't just stop on the SONY side. I led the art
            direction for junior designers to create a campain around the YouView social media channels to
            promote the arrival of the new partnership
