                        Trainline has multiple areas on its platform where promotional content can be placed. To save
                        development time these
                        sections are controlled by a CMS tool. The issue with this, was a lack of a template system,
                        with multiple sizes and
                        styles of sections with no solid theme across them.
                        I took control of this as the team i worked with controlled the CMS tool, crafting documentation
                        and guides for
                        engineering to create a uniform visual and interactive style to ensure users can all navigate
                        through the platforms.

                    <h3>Push to app</h3>

                    <p>Trainline wanted to promote their app to users to move from the mobile version of the website.
                        With this in mind, we
                        introduced certain promotional messages to the user to highlight the benefits they would receive
                        if they used the app.
                        <br> <br>
                        We wanted to ensure that we were promoting the content to the people who wanted to use the app,
                        especially as the data
                        told us there was a strong feeling across mainland europe where users prefer to use mobile
                        websites rather than apps .

                    <h3>Marketing preferences</h3>

                    <p>It was key to enable the users to be able to control their marketing information. When i arrived
                        at Trainline, this was
                        wrapped up in enabling the user to see vital user journey. <br> <br><br> <br>Working with
                        multiple internal teams we
                        created a proof of concept to split out the marketing channel messages from the journey
                        information. Although this
                        started as a simple idea, it escalated with information having to communicate through different
                        databases spending on
                        where the user signed up and which platform they chose their options on

                    <h3>Marketing Opt in / Opt out</h3>

                    <p>For different user scenarios, based on user marketing preferences, we wanted to add in a few
                        alternative approaches to
                        allow the user to Opt-in or Opt-out to relevant marking messages. We had to incorporate a wide
                        array of scenarios here,
                        as users could have chosen their marketing preferences on a different device that they were now
                        on and not all of the
                        Trainline databases shared this information with each other. <br> <br>We also had scenarios
                        where users had previously
                        purchases tickets as a ‘guest’ account and we had to investigate how those choices could be
                        brought into their account
                        as the tickets were also brought over. <br> <br> <br>
                        For these scenarios we put a subset of users into multivariate testing to see which option
                        worked best, hitting
                        Trainline targets with no diminishing returns for the end user

                        missing a strong future vision. Working with a
                        collection of Trainline employees i helped to craft a long term strategy piece which would
                        create interest in the
                        platform with the goal of rewarding users who remain customers year in, year out.<br> <br>
                        We decided to focus on the problem that Traibnline currently treated their userbase exactly the
                        dame on day 1 on the
                        platform as they did on day 1000. We wanted to show how trainline could reward the users who
                        came back
                        <br> <br>
                        With our problem statement agreed, I went away and worked on some high level conceptual pieces
                        which could in turn form
                        an overall long-term focus ready to be split into manageable product stories and projects.
                        <br> <br>Once these were presented back we had positive feedback on three ideas we were
                        recommended to take forward,
                        These were….

                    <p style="color: var( --dark)">Here we crafted a way to reward users. We had two different
                        approaches which we designed and took into user testing.
                        <br> <br>
                        The first approach was to give the user points as a reward system. This could then unlock
                        rewards to further the users
                        experience given them access to unique awards and limited availability discounts.<br> <br>
                        As this was all conceptual pieces of work we could really push the interaction design and
                        utilise patterns and logic
                        that didn’t currently exist on the platforms. Using figma to create prototypes allowed us to
                        create fast turnaround for
                        usability testing to really get user feedback on our overall concept pieces

                        <br>This one off payment could
                        save money for a user making journeys regularly and was an easy way to encourage users to stay
                        on the platform post
                        journey. <br> <br>My hypothesis was by ensuring we the users side, even with a loss on the
                        journey this could help
                        transfer users from a one time purchase to a reoccurring customer.

                    <p style="color: var( --dark)">The first piece of work was created to enable users to see the
                        benefits of Trainline as they became more frequent users.
                        I conceived up ways to show the user how much money they had saved by using Trainline,
                        highlighting unique features that
                        the user couldn't get anywhere else such as SplitSave (a way Trainline splits tickets for a
                        cheaper fare) as well as CO2
                        savings and time savings compared to travelling by car.<br> <br>
                        This in turn would co-exist with the company's existing sustainability practises and would long
                        term give the user a
                        full view of their savings beyond exclusively cost.<br> <br>

                        There were various aspects of the design that we iterated the phone. The initial design started
                        with an interactive
                        graph, which users would instinctively be able to see how their savings have grown over the last
                        30 days 90 days or six
                        months. <br> <br>This in tern was connected to an overall number at the top of the screen, which
                        would been updated with
                        a growing accumulated savings since the user had been a trainline member

                        This graph also became a great way to also upsell of the savings accumulated jour instance an
                        easy way for the user to
                        jump into the sustainability story section of the app to see how much CO2 they had saved before
                        we could integrate the
                        long-term vision without removing the MVP speed of build and iteration .<br> <br>

                        When user are testing we also looked at giving the user the ability to see exactly where they
                        had saved their money.
                        This could have been done between individual journeys individual journey times or destinations
                        during user testing. This
                        didn’t have as much positive response as I initially thought uses saying that although it’s
                        quite beneficial, it didn’t
                        really add to the oval experience so this was and then the user would do this much epoured from
                        the MVP and Was put in
                        the backlog to work on and design further
