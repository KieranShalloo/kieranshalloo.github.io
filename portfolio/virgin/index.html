                        There was a clear plan from the company perspective. Virgin Media wanted to empower its
                        users to
                        solve any issue's themselves. With that in mind, we wanted to make journeys as easy as
                        possible
                        to understand. <br><br>We never wanted users to struggle to find the information they
                        needed. They
                        also
                        always wanted to be proactive in communication with the end-user.

                        The bill overview was the main landing section of the billing area, and as such, it was the
                        first section I wanted to tackle. I wanted to utilise the working patterns of the already
                        released sections of the experience. The last thing a user wants to do is to have to relearn
                        the patterns of a website midway through. <br><br>


                        I introduced an easier way for the end-user to navigate throughout the months of their
                        contract, as well as giving them the ability to compare the cost of this month to previous
                        ones. The only way to do this on the existing website was to download each bill
                        individually, so we made this an easy to see design element, which could then be expanded
                        upon in the future, by incorporating additional spending<br><br>


                        The work had huge success within this project, showing that <strong>9/10 users
                        </strong>could solve the problem using the information we presented to them. The data for
                        this result came from a <strong>containment rate of 89.5% of users </strong>clicking that
                        they needed no additional help in the on-screen dialogue presented to them after their
                        journey.

                    <p>

                        With a big change in the way the billing area looked and functioned, I pitched the idea of a
                        walkthrough guide for both new customers and people who were being brought through into the
                        new version of billing. <br>I was inspired by the onboarding style of phone applications,
                        which allow a user to learn about new sections of the UI as and when they needed them. We
                        had some difficulties with being able to explain certain features as the user may not have
                        interacted with their bill in a particular way, and I didn’t want a new area to pop up in
                        the future without an explanation, whilst also not wanting to force a new onboarding the
                        next time a customer opened the web page.<br><br>

                        In the end, I decided on using real billing data but showing all the possible fields a user
                        may face. This allowed them to see every area they might interact with in the future, which
                        could also be hidden when they finished the onboarding session. <br>I took the prototype
                        through a few iterations of user testing, focusing on what a customer would expect to be
                        shown, as well as incorporating as much data tracking from the existing website.
                        <br><br>This in turn ensured that the most clicked items were shown to a user so they knew
                        where to find them in future.

                        Notifications gave us the opportunity to give warning of events to the users when they
                        arrive on
                        pages<br><br>
                        I wanted to ensure that users were aware of changes to their bills, as well as reassure
                        them
                        when they had actioned something on the website concerning approach billing. I decided
                        to
                        use the notification pattern that was in use in other areas of the project. By
                        introducing a
                        level system of notifications. We could create easy to dismiss notifications when no
                        user
                        action is required up to emergency customer interaction is needed events.
                        Long term these could also be used to make users aware of future billing events. An
                        example
                        is a higher than expected bill due to On Demand content being purchased previously. By
                        solving the problem of unexpectedly high costs we make the user feel more in control of
                        their billing.

                        Existing data showed that the number of users navigating to the billing area from
                        outside
                        the virgin media website was skewed dramatically towards not being logged in. We wanted

                        their
                        problem, before being pushed to log in. With that in mind, I reimagined the journeys for
                        anonymous users. These designs were just about to be launched as I joined the project so
                        I

                        by improving the flows to a more logical paginated state, at the same time reducing some
                        of
                        the videos and additional media which was slowing the web page down and which data

                        was

                        account.

                        To do this we explored various aspects of not just the actual bills, but how could we
                        ensure
                        that the customer knew any upcoming payments which were due to be paid in the near

                    <p>The usage stats of the project showed that existing customers were only logging into the
                        site
                        less than 20% of the time. <br><br>
                        Feedback from users showed that there was a variety of problems with the login journey,
                        but
                        due to security reasons, these wouldn’t be fixed in a reasonable time.
                        <br><br>
                        Our data team reported that the main issue that users noted was forgetting their
                        username
                        and/or password with 9/10 customers saying they would rather just exit the site rather
                        than
                        trying to reset the password.

                        <br><br>
                        With this in mind, I was given a short spike to investigate an alternative way for users
                        to
                        log in. After numerous ideation sessions with the wider agile team, I settled on the use
                        of
                        a One Time Password entry.
                        <br><br>
                        This allowed a user to receive a code via SMS or Email, they could use that code to log
                        into
                        their account. In line with Virgin Media security protocols, this was also restricted to
                        being on their local WiFi network associated with the account to protect private
                        information.
                        <br><br>
                        The first iteration of this feature was only used to allow someone to pay their bill as a
                        proof of concept on both the design and technical side and was met by unanimous approval
                        in
                        customer feedback sessions

                        As the user feedback is under an NDA, I can only share some stats and results from our
                        user
                        testing sessions.
                        <br><br>
                        Across the features I worked on, we saw a 200% increase in satisfaction vs other areas
                        of
                        the new project.
                        <br><br>
                        We also saw 93.4% of people in our testing sessions responding positively to my 'Quick
                        Pay'
                        feature with most participants commenting on its ease of use and clear messaging as well
                        as
                        90% of people feeling that they could solve their issue without needing to phone a call
                        centre, which was the main goal of the project.
